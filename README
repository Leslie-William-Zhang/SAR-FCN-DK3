FULLY CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS FOR MULTI-TEMPORAL SAR IMAGE CLASSIFICATION

These are a set of functions to apply a fully convolutional network on a multi-temporal SAR images based on

A. G. Mullissa, C. Persello, andV.Tolpekin, “Fully convolutional networks for multi-temporal SAR image classification,” in Proc. IEEE Int. Geosci. Remote Sens. Symp., 2018, pp. 6635–6638.

The original implementation was in matlab using the MatConvNwt library. This is the same version implemented in Python.
