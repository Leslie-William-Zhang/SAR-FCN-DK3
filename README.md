# FULLY CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS FOR MULTI-TEMPORAL SAR IMAGE CLASSIFICATION

These are a set of functions to train and test a fully convolutional network on a multi-temporal SAR images. These codes are based on the paper:

A. G. Mullissa, C. Persello, andV.Tolpekin, “Fully convolutional networks for multi-temporal SAR image classification,” in Proc. IEEE Int. Geosci. Remote Sens. Symp., 2018, pp. 6635–6638.

The original implementation was in matlab using the MatConvNet library. This is the same version implemented in Python.
